const exampleCreed = `## Identity
Product designer turned solo founder. I value clarity over cleverness
and ship small, polished things. Default to plain language; I dislike jargon.

## Goals
- Launch the v1 private beta by the end of Q3.
- Reach 1,000 weekly active users before raising.

## Preferences
- Lead with the answer, then the reasoning. Skip "great question" preambles.
- Push back when I'm wrong instead of agreeing politely.

## Routines
- Deep-work mornings, 8 to 12, no calls. Schedule meetings after lunch.
- Sleep 11pm to 7am. Don't suggest tasks past 10pm.`;

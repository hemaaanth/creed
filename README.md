**One file across every agent.**

Write yourself down once. Every AI you use reads it before answering,
and proposes updates as it learns you. You approve the good ones.

## What is Creed?

Anyone using AI seriously pays the same tax: re-explaining themselves every chat, every tool, every session. Creed (creed.md) kills that tax with one file.

Your Creed is a curated personal context profile in plain Markdown, sized to read in under a minute. Connected agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, Devin, and any MCP client) read it before they answer you, and propose edits as they learn new things. The file sharpens over time instead of rotting in your notes.

It is not a notes app, a journal, or a memory dump. If you already maintain a hand-rolled `CLAUDE.md` or a "things ChatGPT gets wrong about me" list, Creed is that file as a real product: first draft written for you, quality scored, one canonical version everywhere, agent edits gated behind your approval.

Ten sections, five always-on (Identity, Goals, Work, Preferences, Routines) and five optional (Beliefs, Constraints, People, Health, Context). Every section is agent-writable, per-section permissions decide whether edits apply directly or wait for review.

**Personal** is the core one-user product. **Company** extends the same file model into a shared workspace: roles, per-section permissions, attribution, invites, pooled AI credits, seat billing.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: **Node 20+** and a free **Supabase** project. (OpenRouter key only for AI features, Stripe only for paid-plan flows.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/connorhpbrn/creed.git
cd creed && npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the five required vars below
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref> && supabase db push
npm run dev                  # → http://localhost:3000
```

Minimum `.env.local` to boot:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable-key>
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=<service-role-key>
CREED_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Every other variable (OpenRouter, Stripe, GitHub sync, branding, feedback) is documented inline in [`.env.example`](./.env.example). `supabase db push` creates the full schema: sections, proposals, activity, tokens, MCP, GitHub, AI usage, audit log, rate limits, entitlements, all behind row-level security.

<details>
<summary><b>Wire up Stripe for the paid flows (optional)</b></summary>

The hosted app gates `/file` behind a paid entitlement. Locally you can skip Stripe entirely (unentitled users land on `/pricing`), or run the full flow: set the four `STRIPE_*` vars from `.env.example` with sandbox keys, then

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

and copy the printed `whsec_…` into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Test payments then auto-grant entitlements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Deploy your own hosted instance</b></summary>

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your deployed origin so OAuth and Stripe redirects resolve.
- Set `CREED_CSP_ENFORCE=1` after watching one deploy cycle in Report-Only mode.
- Create a live Stripe webhook endpoint at `https://<your-domain>/api/stripe/webhook` and use its signing secret.
- Example agent prompts referencing `https://creed.md` are illustrative; real URLs derive from your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

</details>

## Connect an agent

Open `/connections` and add the Creed MCP URL to your agent as a custom connector. The client opens a browser, you click **Allow**, done. No tokens to copy.

Creed is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`, `/.well-known/*`), so any spec-compliant MCP client connects from the server URL alone. First-class connect flows exist for Claude Code (one-line `claude mcp add`), Codex, Cursor (one-click), ChatGPT, Devin, OpenClaw, Hermes, OpenCode, Factory, Manus, and custom agents. Clients that do not speak MCP can use the documented `/api/creed` HTTP API.

Creed also ships a first-party terminal client. It uses the same OAuth screen
and discovers every tool, resource, and prompt from the live MCP server, so a
new MCP tool appears in the CLI without a second implementation or release.

```bash
npx creed-cli
```

Agents get three verbs: read the file, propose an update, or direct-edit where you have granted it. The MCP health dashboard tracks per-agent reads, edits, proposals, and outcomes while keeping CLI activity separate.

## Fork-local development

This fork runs local development in rootless Podman. The source worktree is
mounted directly at `/app`; dependencies and Next's runtime cache live in
per-worktree named volumes. Secrets come from the scoped 1Password Environment,
not a plaintext `.env` file.

```bash
mise run dev
```

Use `mise run dev-down` to stop it. To run another worktree alongside it, set
`CREED_DEV_PORT` before invoking `scripts/podman-dev.sh`; the wrapper gives each
worktree separate volumes automatically.

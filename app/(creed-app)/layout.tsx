//   1. signed in? if not → /pricing
//   2. has a paid creed_entitlements row? if not → /onboarding
//   3. has a persisted personal Creed row? if not → /onboarding
//
// The app is the paid product, so unpaid users are sent to /onboarding
// (where they can finish onboarding and hit "Get Creed"), never into the
// app. Step 3 catches users who deep-link to /file (or come back via a
// stale browser tab) without having completed onboarding yet. It checks
// the Creed row (created by the onboarding claim step), NOT the section
// count - a user who deletes every section still has a Creed and must
// not be bounced back into first-run onboarding.
//
// Marketing routes and /payment/* don't pass through here so they remain
// reachable to anyone. The check uses the user's own session client +
// the "Read own entitlement" RLS policy - no admin escalation needed.
//
// This layout (not the root) owns the dynamic, user-specific boundary now:
// AuthedProviders loads the Creed and supplies CreedProvider, and the gate
// reads the session, so the segment renders dynamically while the root stays

// Balance + recent ledger for the settings credits card. Read via the user's
// session client (RLS select-own); doubles as the "did my top-up land yet?"
// poll after a Payment Element confirmation. Company-aware: any member viewing a
// company Creed sees the pooled company balance; the purchase-history ledger is
// stripped for non-owners (they can view spend, not buy or audit top-ups).
//
// A `?creedId=` query param pins the read to that company Creed (validated for
// membership), so the company settings card always loads THAT company's pooled
// balance rather than depending on the active-Creed cookie. No param -> fall back
// to the active Creed (cookie), preserving the personal + single-context reads.

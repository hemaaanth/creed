//   - paid: switches the final CTA between the checkout path ("Start for
//     $12/mo") and "Go to my Creed" (straight into the app) once they
//     already have access.
//   - initialStage: resume point. A composed Creed resumes on the preview; a
//     claimed-but-not-composed seed resumes on the prompt step; otherwise the
//     screen starts at step 0.
